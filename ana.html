<p style="clear:both;">
Also I need to take on and be a part of large no of projects to help me learn more!
Yes it would require a lot of efforts to learn'em all, but i think the folks at the SDSLabs would help me with their guidance in doing that.
</p><p>Amidst this , there will be times when I would feel depressed or get out of track.<br />
At those times this motto of <span style="font-weight:bold;">Swami VivekAnand</span> can be very helpful:</p>
